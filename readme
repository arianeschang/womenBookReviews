Hello! This is a copy of the code that was used to statistically analyze the New York Times book review data that we had. I was given the data, named initialMeta.csv and initialMetaWC.csv (the word counts for the reviews). With this I made a scraper for the New York Times, which found the original article and added the title of the book to the data. With this, I scraped goodreads to find each book and its' associated, user-generated theme list. I then created a statistical analysis of the data with odds-ratios and p-values to discover which themes were most biased. 

The scrapers don't really work anymore, as it's been quite a long time. However, the statistical analysis still runs just fine! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at ariane.schang@mail.mcgill.ca
